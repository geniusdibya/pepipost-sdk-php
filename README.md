## Installation (OS Friendly)

Inorder to make it Smooth we have Separated installation process with respective OS which will help you to go step by step without any interuption.

1. [Build SDK on Windows without any IDE.](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/blob/feature_x/pepipost-sdk-php/windows-Installation-1.md)
2. [Build SDK on Windows/Linux with IDE.](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/blob/feature_x/pepipost-sdk-php/windows-installation-2.md)
3. [Build SDK on Linux.](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/blob/feature_x/pepipost-sdk-php/linux-installation.md)

### Prerequisites
* 1. [PHP >=5.4.0](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)

<a name="quickstart"></a>
## Quick Start

Developers already familar with GIT, Composer and some of the other handy tools can just refer the below steps to quick start with the integration. 

> If you are not sure of how to integrate this library within your environment, then please refer to our detailed [installation](#installation) guide above.

 1. Open Command prompt/Terminal.
 
 2. Change directory to any new directory (Make directory test-- recommended).
 
 3. [Download or Clone](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/archive/feature_x.zip) the Pepipost Repository to the new directory and extract.
 
 4. Check php version using **```php -v```**
 
 5. Check Composer version **```composer --version```**
 
 6. Navigate to your directory where the pepipost-php library is extracted (using cd path\to\directory)
 
 7. Type **```composer install```** (this will install all the requirement needed to run this library -- Note: After installing, a vendor directory will get auto-created)
 
 8. Create a new test file in same directory **```test.php```**
 
 9. Copy the code from [simpleUsage.md](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/blob/feature_x/pepipost-sdk-php/simpleUsage.md) or [sampleExample](https://github.com/hellovikram/pepipost-php/blob/feature_x/pepipost-sdk-php/README.md#sample-usage) and paste in test.php.
  
 10. Get your API key and Sending Domain from your Pepipost account. 
  
  **```apikey```** will be available under **```Login to Pepipost -> Settings -> Integration```**
  
  **```Sending Domain```** will be available under **```Login to Pepiost -> Settings -> Sending Domains ```**

```
  *Note :: Domains showing wiht Active status on Sending Domain dashboard are only allowed to send any sort of emails.* In case there are no Sending Domain added under your account, then first add the domain, get the DNS (SPF/DKIM) settings done and get it reviewed by our compliance team for approval. Once the domain is approved, it will be in ACTIVE status and will be ready to send any sort of emails. 
```

 11. Make the required changes in your script test.php (Adding the apikey and Sending Domain is mandatory).
 
 Change your **```$apiKey = 'api-XX-key-XX-here'```** to **```$apiKey = 'api-key-of-your-pepipost-account';```**
 
 Similarly, update your Sending Domain from **```$body->from->fromEmail = 'admin@myfirsttest.com';```** to **```$body->from->fromEmail = 'admin@your-active-domain-on-pepipost';```**

12. Update the rest of the email related payload like Recipent email address, content of the email etc. Below is the sample code with details of payload:

## Sample Code for test.php

```php
<?php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
$client = new PepipostAPILib\PepipostAPIClient();
$emailController = $client->getEmail();

// Your Pepipost API Key
$apiKey = 'api-XX-key-XX-here'; #add apikey from panel here

$body = new PepipostAPILib\Models\EmailBody();

// List of Email Recipients
$body->personalizations = array();
$body->personalizations[0] = new PepipostAPILib\Models\Personalizations;
$body->personalizations[0]->recipient = 'Youremailid@XXX.com';               #To/Recipient email address

// Email Header
$body->from = new PepipostAPILib\Models\From;
$body->from->fromEmail = 'admin@myfirsttest.com';   #Sender Domain. Note: The sender domain should be verified and active under your Pepipost account.
$body->from->fromName = 'Test Admin';       #Sender/From name

//Email Body Content
$body->subject = 'Pepipost mail through php sdk';               #Subject of email
$body->content = '<html><body>Hello, Email testing is successful. <br> Hope you enjoyed this integration. <br></html>'; #HTML content which need to be send in the mail body

// Email Settings
$body->settings = new PepipostAPILib\Models\Settings;
$body->settings->clicktrack = 1;    #clicktrack for emails enable=1 | disable=0
$body->settings->opentrack = 1;     #opentrack for emails enable=1 | disable=0
$body->settings->unsubscribe = 1;   #unsubscribe for emails enable=1 | disable=0

$response = $emailController->createSendEmail($apiKey,$body);   #function sends email
print_r(json_encode($response));
?>
```

| Parameter | Tags | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| apiKey |  ``` Mandatory ```  | This is a unique string for authentication. Example '523326ed4sadasb39dfa932ff5fa84ed9ed8' |
