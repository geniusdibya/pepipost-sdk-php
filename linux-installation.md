### Installation Steps for Building SDk

The Code has few Dependencies which we have listed in our ```composer.json``` file which comes with our SDK.
Below Steps will Guide you Step by Step, So that your installation is completed Smoothly.

  1. Open Command prompt/ terminal. 

  2. Change Directory to any new directory (Make directory test-- recommended).

  3. Check PHP version (should be >= 5.4.0)
     
     ```php -v```
     
     ![phpinstall](http://app1.falconide.com/integration_imgs/linux/l1.png)
      
      or you can install [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.debian.php) if it is not installed
    
  4. Check composer version 
  
     ```composer --version```
     
     ![comp](http://app1.falconide.com/integration_imgs/linux/l1.1.png)
     
     or download [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if composer is not installed
 
  5. Download SDK 
  
     Check whether Git is installed or not 
 
        *Note :: This is not mandatory you can also download zip of SDK if you don't want to clone we will go by git clone method both methods are described below.*
 
        **Git method**
  
        Clone [Pepipost PHP Repo](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-php.git)
      
        Using **git clone https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-php.git**

      apikey will be available from login to pepipost -> settings -> integration

      Sending Domain will be available from login to pepiost -> settings -> Sending Domains

      **note :: only Active Domains are allowed**
  
      Make neccessary Changes in Script (apikey and Sending Domain -- mandatory changes).
     Change your $apiKey = 'api-XX-key-XX-here' to $apiKey = 'api-key-from-panel';

   Similarly Change your Sending Domain from $body->from->fromEmail = 'admin@myfirsttest.com'; to $body->from->fromEmail = 'admin@your-active-domain-from-panel';
