# Steps to install Pepipost PHP Code Library on Windows without IDE

This doc is dedicated to all terminal lovers who ❤️ to code on terminal.

Below steps will help you in integrating this PHP code library on a Windows machine which doesn't have any IDE. 

> Optional Note: This library will be sending HTTP calls to Pepipost server and hence if you're running any firewalls on your machine, then please whitelist the API base URL ```api.pepipost.com``` with ```port 443/80```

### Installation Steps

This code has dependencies over external libraries like UniRest. All dependencies are listed in the file ```composer.json```.

We are trying to cover each of the steps in this installation, which might make this doc a little lengther but the objective is to help you with the simpliest way of installation. 

While Pepipost DX Team is defintely leading this library, but we want this to be more community driven. Your help is needed to realize this goal and to make sure we are building the right things in the right order. We ask that you create ![issues](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-php/issues) and ![pull requests](https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-sdk-php/pulls) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests to keep everyone updated.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you! Let's move ahead on the installation steps:

13. Make a Sample file named **test.php** in the unzipped directory as shown below
 
![testfile](http://app1.falconide.com/integration_imgs/windows_without_IDE/20.png)
